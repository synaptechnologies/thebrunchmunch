Brunch Munch — Detailed Pitch & Sales Playbook

Purpose
- This document is a long-form reference you can use when pitching Brunch Munch to small business owners (especially in Ghana). It provides clear answers to "why" they should buy the system today, objection handling, pricing and negotiation language, sales scripts (WhatsApp and in-person), short-term and long-term ROI examples, a deployment checklist for Google Sheets + Apps Script, plus recommended KPIs and upsell ideas. Use this to study, pick lines, and adapt to each customer.

Quick summary (3 lines you can say fast)
- "Keep WhatsApp the same — we add a simple backend so every submitted checkout is recorded (payment must still be confirmed via WhatsApp)."
- "No hosting, no extra apps for customers — we use Google Sheets and Apps Script, which you own."
- "Starter setup is GHC 2,500; premium with a dashboard is GHC 3,500. It pays for itself quickly by making follow-up easier and enabling targeted promotions."

Section A — Core "Why" answers (concise answers you can use verbally)
1) Why should I get this? (short)
- Because WhatsApp is a conversation tool, not an order database. Every missed or misread message costs money. Our system records each submitted checkout from the web flow in a structured way so you can find, export, and act on orders without hunting through chat. Recording an order does not prove payment — owners should confirm payment through WhatsApp and update the order status in the sheet.

2) Why not just keep using WhatsApp like we do now? (short)
- In the short term it works, but as you scale you lose orders, make reconciliation mistakes, and miss promotion opportunities. A small up-front investment prevents errors that compound monthly and gives you data to grow revenue.

3) Why Google Sheets + Apps Script? (short)
- No new hosting or subscriptions, easy ownership and handover, and a simple secure endpoint. Owners keep control of their data and can export CSV anytime.

4) Why should I pay now instead of later? (short)
- The sooner you capture structured data, the sooner you can act on it. Two months of structured sales means better promotions, faster inventory decisions, and immediate reductions in lost orders — delaying increases the opportunity cost.

Section B — Deep dive: why this matters (evidence & scenarios)
1) Lost orders and reconciliation
- Scenario: A customer confirms by chat but the business owner misses the message while busy; the rider leaves; payment gets delayed; the owner loses repeat business. With structured order recording, every submitted checkout creates a row (timestamp, phone, items, totals). The sheet helps you follow up reliably — payment confirmation still happens in WhatsApp and must be recorded in the sheet (status: pending/confirmed/paid).
- Impact: Improving follow-up can recover lost orders. For planning, use conservative estimates: if follow-up recovers 1–3 additional paid orders weekly at an AOV of GHC 150, that is meaningful recovered revenue compared with the one-time cost of the system.

2) Marketing and promotions
- With order-level data you can run targeted promos: top sellers, returning customers, and seasonal bundles. Example: identify top 5 items for Valentine week and offer a limited bundle; track conversion rate on submitted checkouts and reconcile later against confirmed/paid orders to measure real revenue impact.

3) Inventory & operations
- Knowing what sells and when lets you buy ingredients smartly and reduce waste. This directly reduces costs (food waste) and improves margins.

4) Customer retention
- Track repeat buyers, send simple discounts for birthdays, or call VIP customers. Repeat customers often have higher lifetime value; even small retention increases (5–10%) can raise revenue materially.

5) Competitive risk
- If a competitor starts using data (promos, loyalty), they can steal repeat customers. Being data-ready prevents avoidable churn.

Section C — Immediate, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month value timeline (talking points)
- Immediate (0–2 weeks): Every submitted checkout is recorded; fewer lost or missed orders are easier to track and reconcile. The system records submissions but does not verify payment — owners should confirm payment via WhatsApp and update the order status.
- 3 months: Regular use of CSV exports for accounting; begin weekly reports (sales by item); first promotion based on data.
- 6 months: Clear repeat-customer list; segmented offers boost AOV; stock planning improves; measurable uplift from the first promotions.
- 12 months: Yearly reports, confident menu changes, and repeatable marketing campaigns. ROI becomes obvious: improved conversion and retention, fewer lost orders, and better margins.

Section D — Measurable KPIs to track (recommend these to the client)
- Orders per day/week/month
- Average order value (AOV)
- Repeat customer rate (30/90/365 day windows)
- Top 10 items by revenue
- Time-to-fulfill (order timestamp -> delivered)
- Orders lost vs. received (manual metric initially)
- Campaign conversion (before/after promo)

Section E — Pricing, packaging, and negotiation strategies
1) Packages
- Starter — GHC 2,500: Apps Script endpoint, client integration (CheckoutModal changes), deployment guide, 1 handover session.
- Premium — GHC 3,500: Starter + Admin Dashboard (list, filters, order details, CSV export) + 1 week support.

2) Upsells and add-ons (optional)
- Analytics reports (monthly): GHC 300/month
- Automated WhatsApp templates + setup: one-off GHC 600
- Custom reports or integrations (e.g., export to accounting): priced per scope

3) Negotiation tactics (phrases and approach)
- Anchor high, offer discount window: "Standard price is GHC 3,500. For you, if you decide this week, we can do GHC 2,800." (gives urgency)
- Scarcity/price increase: "We are onboarding a few clients at this price; after the current month our basic price will increase." (only use if truthful)
- Payment options: 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. Offer a small discount for full upfront payment.
- If pushback on price: quantify the return (saved orders x AOV x margin). Example: "If we recover 4 lost orders a week at GHC 150, that's GHC 2,400 per month — the system pays for itself in roughly one month."

4) When to hold firm
- If client is price-sensitive but a high-volume shop (large Instagram following), remind them of scale benefits and upsell the dashboard.

Section F — Objection handling (common questions & suggested responses)
1) "We already use WhatsApp" — Response: "Great — we don't change that. We record each submitted checkout into a spreadsheet you own; payment still happens via WhatsApp. You keep your WhatsApp process and gain a searchable order history (use the `status` column to mark pending/confirmed/paid)."

2) "It’s expensive" — Response: "Think of it as insurance and marketing data combined. Even a handful of recovered orders or a single successful promo will cover the cost quickly; I can show an example based on your AOV."

3) "We don’t want to learn new tools" — Response: "The owner just opens Google Sheets — nothing new for customers. We provide a one‑page handover and support the first week. The admin dashboard is optional; you can keep using the sheet."

4) "What about privacy and data security?" — Response: "The Google Sheet and Apps Script are deployed in the owner's Google account; they retain ownership and control. We recommend a secret token for the endpoint and limited sharing permissions on the Sheet."

5) "What if the script stops working?" — Response: "We provide a simple health-check and a recovery step in the handover. For Premium clients we include one week of support; for Starter, we provide instructions. We also include error logging guidance."

6) "Will customers need to install anything?" — Response: "No: customers use WhatsApp as usual. The only change is the checkout flow in the web UI that sends the order to Sheets before opening WhatsApp."

Section G — Sales scripts (copy/paste ready)
1) Short WhatsApp pitch (initial outreach)
- "Hi [Name], I build a small system that lets you keep using WhatsApp while saving every order into a Google Sheet you own. It reduces lost orders, makes reconciliation easy, and gives data to run promotions. Starter setup is GHC 2,500 — can I send details?"

2) Longer WhatsApp pitch (if interested)
- "Thanks for replying. Quick summary: we keep your WhatsApp ordering the same. When a customer checks out online, the checkout is recorded in a Google Sheet with timestamp, phone, items, totals, and notes. You get searchable order history, CSV export for your accountant, and an optional dashboard for quick filters. Note: the system records submissions — payment is confirmed via WhatsApp and should be marked in the sheet. Starter is GHC 2,500; Premium (dashboard) GHC 3,500. Want a short demo?"

3) In-person pitch (2–3 minute version)
- Opening: "You already sell through WhatsApp — that’s great. My job is to make every order count."
- Problem: "Right now orders live in chat, get mixed with other messages, and sometimes slip through. You also can't easily see which items sell best or who your repeat customers are."
- Solution: "We add a simple backend using Google Sheets so every confirmed order becomes a row you can search and export. No extra apps for customers; everything is owned by you."
- Close: "Starter is GHC 2,500. If you want a dashboard, we do that for GHC 3,500. If you decide now we can start deployment this week."

4) Follow-up message templates
- After initial pitch, no reply (48 hours): "Hi [Name], did you get a chance to think about the order capture system I sent? I can show a one-minute demo if you like."
- After demo, no decision (1 week): "Hi [Name], any questions about the demo? I'd be happy to adjust scope to fit your needs or budget." 

Section H — Closing lines and urgency techniques (use ethically)
- Limited onboarding slots: "We take a small number of new clients each month to ensure quality onboarding — booking now reserves your slot."
- Early-bird price: "Clients who sign this month get the Starter price locked in; later prices may change as demand grows."
- ROI reminder: "Remember, recovering even a few orders per week covers the cost — and a single well-targeted promo can multiply revenue."

Section I — Technical overview (non-technical language you can explain to clients)
1) What we build
- A secure Apps Script endpoint that accepts POST requests with order JSON.
- A Google Sheet with a single row per submitted checkout (columns: order id, timestamp, phone, name, address/GPS link, items JSON, subtotal, delivery fee, tax, total, notes, status). The `status` column is used by the owner to track payment/confirmation (e.g., pending, confirmed, paid).
- Client-side update in `CheckoutModal` that posts to the endpoint then opens WhatsApp.
- Optional static admin dashboard (Premium) that reads the sheet via the Google Sheets API or a published JSON endpoint and displays filters & details.

2) Security and ownership
- The Apps Script is published under the client’s Google account (they own the script + sheet).
- We secure the endpoint by checking a secret token in request headers.
-- Share settings: keep the sheet private and grant view/edit only to specific staff. Recommend a simple staff process: when payment is confirmed in WhatsApp, mark the order `paid` and add any receipt or note to the row so accounting can reconcile later.

3) Reliability
- Google Sheets + Apps Script is surprisingly reliable for small businesses and removes hosting costs. For higher scale we can move to a lightweight hosted DB later.

Section J — Deployment checklist (step-by-step for the client)
1) Prepare a Google account (owner email).
2) Create a new Google Sheet and name it "BrunchMunch Orders".
3) Open Apps Script (Extensions → Apps Script) and paste the provided script.
4) Set a secret token in the script (config variable) and share that with the web client (kept private in environment variable in the front-end build or in .env for local dev).
5) Deploy the script as a web app (do not set access to "anyone" without token — use execute as owner and require POST with token verification).
6) Update `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in `src/components/cart/CheckoutModal.jsx` to the deployed web app URL.
7) Run a test order (developer or owner) and verify a new row in the sheet. Confirm the `status` defaults to `pending`, then simulate the WhatsApp confirmation and mark the row `paid` to verify the full workflow.
8) If Premium: deploy the static dashboard or host inside the same repo and point it to the sheet's read endpoint.
9) Provide one handover session showing how to open the sheet, filter, and export CSV.

Section R — Domain & hosting (recurring costs)
- Domain: typically GHC 150–200 per year. This is purchased by the client and renews annually.
- Hosting (optional): if the client wants the Admin Dashboard hosted on a custom domain or needs a small static host, estimate ~GHC 100/year for basic hosting. This is the only recurring fee associated with the solution.
- Notes: The core Starter package (Google Sheets + Apps Script) requires no external hosting — Apps Script runs within Google and the Sheet is stored in the client's Google Drive. Domain and hosting are only required if the client requests a public site or a hosted dashboard on their own domain.

Section K — Data format example (quick sample row)
- order_id: BM-20260204-001
- timestamp: 2026-02-04T14:22:08Z
- phone: +233XXXXXXXXX
- customer_name: Mary Mensah
- address: 23 High St, Accra (or GPS link)
- items_json: [{"id":12,"name":"Chocolate Cake","qty":1,"price":250}] 
- subtotal: 250
- delivery_fee: 15
- tax: 0
- total: 265
- notes: "No nuts"

Section L — Admin Dashboard: feature suggestions (for Premium)
- Orders table with sortable columns (date, customer, total)
- Filters: date range, status, customer phone, search by item
- Order details panel (show items, notes, phone link to WhatsApp)
- CSV export for selected rows
- Simple charts: weekly revenue, top items

Section M — Sample KPI-driven marketing plan (90 days)
- Week 0–2: Setup and baseline reporting. Identify top 10 items.
- Week 3–6: Run a 10% discount campaign for top 3 items; measure uplift.
- Week 7–12: Launch a loyalty SMS/WhatsApp template for repeat customers. Track repeat purchases.
- Metrics to watch: uplift in AOV, repeat customer rate, conversion on promos.

Section N — Legal & ownership notes (talking points)
- Ownership: Client retains ownership of the Google Sheet and Apps Script.
- Data retention: default Sheet persists until deleted; suggest routine exports/backups for accounting.
- Privacy: recommend minimal data collection (name, phone, address) and do not store payment card data in the sheet.

Section O — Upsell & long-term product roadmap ideas (for client discussions)
- Loyalty program integration (points)
- Automated receipts by WhatsApp or SMS
- Multi-branch support with aggregated reporting
- Inventory module tied to orders

Section P — Example objections + rebuttals (long-form answers you can study)
- Objection: "We have low margins and can't spend money on this." 
  Response: "I understand margins are tight. Two ways to think about this: (1) reduce leakage — even a few recovered orders a week increases revenue directly; (2) targeted promotions driven by data can increase average order value and frequency. We can run a six-week trial promotion and measure results; if it doesn't show value we adjust."

- Objection: "We already have a bookkeeper who tracks orders manually." 
  Response: "Manual systems are expensive in time and error-prone. A simple export every month reduces bookkeeping time and error reconciliation. The cost of the system is far less than ongoing manual hours for many businesses."

- Objection: "What if Google changes Apps Script policies?" 
  Response: "Changes are rare; Apps Script has been stable for years. If your volume grows beyond Sheets, we can migrate to a small cloud DB with minimal redevelopment."
