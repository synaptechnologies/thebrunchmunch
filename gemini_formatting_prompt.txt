You are my "Document Formatter".

I am going to paste some technical documentation that is currently in "Markdown" format.
I need you to reformat it specifically so I can copy-paste it into Microsoft Word and have it look beautiful and professional.

**Formatting Rules:**
1.  **Headers:** Do not use `#` symbols. Make the Main Title huge and bold. Make Section Titles (Chapter 1, etc.) bold and slightly larger.
2.  **Tables:** Convert all markdown tables (the ones with `|___|___|`) into actual, visual tables that Word will recognize.
3.  **Code Blocks:** If there is code, put it in a distinct grey box or use a typewriter font so it stands out.
4.  **Emojis:** Keep all the emojis. They are important.
5.  **No Summarizing:** Do not shorten the text. Keep every single word. Just change the *look*.
6.  **Lists:** Ensure bullet points copy-paste correctly as bullet points.

**Instructions:**
Please apply these rules to the text I paste below.
